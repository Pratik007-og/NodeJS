In the common parlance, randomness is the apparent lack of pattern or predictability in events.
A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible
pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but since they
often follow a probability distribution, the frequency of different outcomes over numerous events
(or "trials") is predictable. For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular
roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness
is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than its haphazardness, and applies to
concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.
